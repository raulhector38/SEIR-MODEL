##SEIR-MODEL

This is a program in which we give a initial conditions to the SEIR-MODEL and it returns a plot in which it shows a simulation.
Here we are using the Runge-Kutta-Fhelberg method to solve the SEIR diferential equations.
Also, the program provides us a Excel file in which we can see all the times and their respective values for all the classes: S(t), I(t), E(t), R(t).
